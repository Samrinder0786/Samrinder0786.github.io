            <h2> Praise for <i> Too Big to Fail</i></h2>
            <q>Vigorously reported, superbly organised... for those of us who didn't pursue MBAs and have the penny-ante salaries to prove it.</q>

            <q> Sorkin's prodigious reporting and lively writing put the readers in the room for some of the biggest-dollar conference calls in history. It's an entertaining, brisk and book.</q>
